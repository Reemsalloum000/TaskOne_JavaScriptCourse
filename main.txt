    pIn the context of developing an interactive and effective user interface, we have created a simple web page dedicated to Ramadan that displays essential information while incorporating various elements such as text, lists, tables, and a search field. Additionally, we have included a symbolic image related to Ramadan to enhance the visual aspect of the page. The goal of this task is to ensure that the page is smooth and user-friendly, while making sure that all elements function correctly and that the image appears clearly and appropriately. We are committed to following best practices in design and programming to ensure an excellent user experience that reflects the spirit of Ramadan.p
